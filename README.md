# linking_EC2
Python package for simplifying working with [EC2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).
Built for automatically uploading [BayesFlow](https://github.com/JonasWallin/BayesFlow).
Warning the program is nowhere near optimal (or safe).

The ipython notebook script/running MPI4py.ipynb shows how to set up a cluster and run a simple mpi4py example.


####TODO:
parallel the loops!!!!
